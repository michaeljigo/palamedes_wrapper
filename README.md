# palamedes_wrapper
A handy wrapper function for the Palamedes toolbox, with a focus on using its adaptive procedures.
You must have the Palamedes toolbox (http://www.palamedestoolbox.org/) installed and in your MATLAB path.

In this repository you will find three functions:
1. usePalamedesStaircase    : initializes and updates the desired staircase/adaptive protocol
2. arbWeibull               : arbitrary psychometric function adapted from a Weibull
3. update_arbitrary_pf      : updates arbitrary psychometric function; adapated from Palamedes code
