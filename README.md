# palamedes_wrapper
A handy wrapper function for the Palamedes toolbox, with a focus on using its adaptive procedures.
You must have the Palamedes toolbox (http://www.palamedestoolbox.org/) installed and in your MATLAB path.

In this repository you will find:
1. usePalamedesStaircase    : initializes and updates the desired staircase/adaptive protocol
2. arbWeibull               : Weibull function with adjustable threshold performance level
3. arbLogistic              : Logistic function with adjustable threshold performance level
4. update_arbitrary_pf      : updates arbitrary psychometric function; adapated from Palamedes code

If you want to suggest any improvements or additional functionality, send me an email at michael.jigo@nyu.edu. I will try my best to get to it.
