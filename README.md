# palamedes_wrapper
A handy wrapper function for the Palamedes toolbox, with a focus on using its adaptive procedures.
You must have the Palamedes toolbox (http://www.palamedestoolbox.org/) installed and in your MATLAB path.

With these functions you will be able to flexibly choose the threshold level of task performance that will be targeted by the adaptive procedure.
If you want to suggest any improvements or additional functionality, send me an email at michael.jigo@nyu.edu. I will try my best to get to it.

Check out the brief tutorials to get started.
